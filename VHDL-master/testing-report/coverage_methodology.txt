coverage methodology:
all db and rcb related files are checked for coverage with the following flags:
statement coverage (s)
branch coverage (b)
condition coverage (c)
expression coverage (e)
0/1 toggle coverage (t)
ignore case statement default choice (-coverexcludedefault)


----
the list of files tested:
db side:
	db.vhd: rcb never blocks db in fill endpt state (after move)
	draw_octant.vhd
	draw_any_octant.vhd

rcb side:
	rcb.vhd: illegal instruction, overspecified finish condition
	ram_fsm.vhd: bugged function
	rmw.vhd
	pix_word_cache.vhd: not covered: illegal instruction (draw same)

<test reports on git>


==================================
with the final test:
- The tool doesnt record coverage for functions properly.
- fsm transitions to/from idle state is not fully tested as the provided testbench host never NOPs until it's done
- rcb never blocks db in fill endpt state (after move)
- Invalid commands are never sent from DB to RCB
